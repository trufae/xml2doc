  XmlDoc is a word processing tool that parses xml documents and output his
content into a nice PDF, AbiWord, HTML and plain text (nowadays :).

  In a little way to explain this project we can say that is a lightweight
version of DocBook, isn't enought powerful compared to DocBook, but it is
little, faster and easier to learn.

  The DTD that uses xml2doc is in continuesly development, and I hope to make
them compatibles between version. It is very easy to learn these tags, because
are very similar to HTML, and reading some xmldocs or reading directly to the
sources you can understand how to use them without any problems.

  XmlDoc uses libxml2 to parse and read XML tags, and pdflib to write PDF
content into the output file. This last library has an "strange license" and
for this reason isn't a debian/package. Its license says that you can use this
library freely if you write in opensource and free code.

  And if you want to write a propietary code you must pay this license.

  This is a GPLed software...by this way I can't get problems using them.

XmlDoc is just a simple text processor that works like DocBook using tags to
define text and image attributes. Is just a lightweight program that allows
you to write nice documents on PDF, HTML and Plain text (at the moment). This
project is always under development.
